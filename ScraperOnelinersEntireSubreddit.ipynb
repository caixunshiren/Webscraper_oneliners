I extend previous research by considering relationship histories pertaining to both premarital sex and premarital cohabitation. I find that premarital sex or premarital cohabitation that is limited to a woman's husband is not associated with an elevated risk of marital disruption. However, women who have more than one intimate premarital relationship have an increased risk of marital dissolution. These results suggest that neither premarital sex nor premarital cohabitation by itself indicate either preexisting characteristics or subsequent relationship environments that weaken marriages. Indeed, the findings are consistent with the notion that premarital sex and cohabitation limited to one's future spouse has become part of the normal courtship process for marriage.

The next day she comes and gives me a french kiss while we were out on a break. I get super excited(inside but calm on the outside) we casually make plans to go for a movie and dinner. She somehow calls up and cancels. Later during the week everything is just like the way it was. She tells me to get some movies for her on a flash drive, a few books. And that Friday she tells me again that she wont make it for the movie as she would be visiting her grandmother. Monday she emails her resignation to her boss and she stops coming to work (as she had some issues with her boss). Moreover she tells me that \"we\" wont click(I'm crushed inside by that point of time).I tell her to return my books and my flash drive. She says \"Shove it. You can forget your stuff.

      "259. Have a serious problem with an old \"friend\" and I'm not quite sure what to do about it... I will refer to the aforementioned friend as David. David and I have been friends since 8th grade and we're both sophomores in college. David goes to school in California and I go to school in Illinois, so we keep in touch via text/IM/phone calls. WARNING: very long story below\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago I got into a relationship with a girl who came from a fairly conservative family, so I never really went beyond kissing her. David inquired about my relationship with her one day and was kind of shocked about the situation. He, eventually, Facebook friended her and acquired her AIM account and chatted with her frequently. My girlfriend told me that I had a very interesting friend, and when I asked her to elaborate, she told me that she'd been talking to David. Over the course of one week, he had evidently tried to get me in the girl's pants (via shitty wingmanning on AIM), so she ended up confronting me about it. Long story short, she broke up with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told David about the situation and, instead of backing off like I asked him to, he would occasionally e-mail/Fb message my ex very lengthy, rude messages about how much of a terrible person she was. Of course, my ex got fed up with it and blocked him on Facebook. However, she also thought that David's actions were an extension of my thoughts, so she also blocked me on Facebook and, essentially, never spoke to me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was, to say the least, pretty fucking pissed off at David, but eventually things boiled over and we laughed off how dumb the situation was. Again, fast forward to October of this year. I was talking to David online and he brought up the relationship with my ex, which I no longer cared to talk about. I attempted evading the topic, but he persisted to talk about people who date that are of differing religions. That prompted me to bring up the relationship between two of my friends (we'll call them Tom and Claire). Tom is a pretty devout Christian and Claire is also from a conservative Muslim family. Tom and Claire dated very briefly last year, but their relationship ended because, in the end, they wouldn't work out. Unlike myself and my ex, though, they are still very good friends and sort of act like they are boyfriend/girlfriend. Anyway, I explained the situation to David in great detail and we both had plenty to say regarding religion/culture and how it affected social life. Pretty interesting conversation, blah blah blah.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, David sends me a text that said something like, \"I just subtly raped your life,\" to which I responded, \"Lol...kewl story bro.\" Turns out he sent different messages to Tom and Claire on Facebook. The one to Tom read: \"So...I heard you like to lick Claire's nipples a lot.\" The one to Claire read: \"So...I heard you like to suck [my name]'s dick.\" He told me what he'd done later in the day, but I didn't really believe him because it was a little bit profound, to say the least. Tom confronted me the Friday of that week, and needless to say, it was a pretty awkward conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I called David, called him out on his immature bullshit, and removed him off Facebook so he wouldn't have the opportunity to mess around with me anymore. For several weeks after that, I had a pending friend request from David with repeated messages that would read like, \"I WILL find a way to get you to be my fb friend. FUCK YOU.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, just recently my girlfriend and I became boyfriend/girlfriend on Facebook (or \"Facebook official\") and to my delight, David seems to stalk my page a lot. He threatened that if I did not accept his friend request that he would \"send a message\" to my girlfriend (direct quote). Clearly, I was fed up by this point, so I simply explained to my girlfriend that David is a dick and had her block him on Facebook. I then texted him saying, \"You are a sociopath...lol.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That caused him to rage hardcore and he actually attempted to send a message to my girlfriend. He texted me a while later, \"Wtf you had her block me? Fair enough, I'll find some way to RAPE your life.\" We went back and forth after I tried to explain that he was being completely ridiculous, but he continued to act like a complete asshole.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a text today in the afternoon that said, \"Btw, if i cant contact [gf's name], i'll find her home and mail her parents. :)\" I did a quick google/White Pages search on my girlfriend's last name + city/state and, indeed, her home address is on the web. Given the past scenarios where David has tried to \"rape\" my life, I wouldn't be surprised if he did indeed send a letter to her home. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know that to deal with future-David, I can block his access to my Facebook and terminate communication with him. However...I am completely unsure of how to deal with his attempted harassment of my girlfriend. Suggestions or thoughts are welcome.\n",

      "261. In your town/state, do you bag your own groceries or stare awkwardly at some teenage girl do it for you? Background: Grew up and went to school in NJ (lived on my own) where pretty much everybody bags their own groceries and when it's busy there would sometimes be somebody walking around helping the elderly, injured, etc.  Now I live in Texas where there is almost always somebody bagging in every lane.  \n",
      "It's awkward watching some small teenage girl try to put big bags of groceries (case of beer) in the cart for a dude in his twenties, doubly so when you pretty hand them reusable bags and then watch.  On second thought, it's a little strange when it's some older guy too.  I've never seen anybody say \"Oh, I'll get it\" and I suppose that the person bagging would just step away and watch anyways, making it weird for them?\n",
      "Personally I'd rather they put that person on another register and let me bag my own stuff so I'm not standing in line forever.  It's not like grabbing things and putting them in a bag is a hassle, especially when you're not doing anything else.\n",
      "So which is more common where you live - tons of people bagging or do you do it yourself?\n",

He was an avid reddit reader and in fact, he used to read and send me the links he thought would interest me or be useful for my work (I teach a sociology of cyberspace course).  Now I have to read reddit myself and it is good that I am off work on a compassionate leave because reading reddit takes up a lot of my day.

      "336. Your Mother is a Scumbag Last Saturday morning on my way out for a much needed cup of joe I stopped at a stop light about 10 feet behind a black Laredo that was clearly too far out into the intersection, i.e. way over the crosswalk. Minding my own business when the Laredo begins to back up at a high rate of speed and crashes, with a significant degree of impact, into the front of my van. Young female driver gets out and says she is sorry and that she didn't see me. I think that's right. We begin to inspect for damage. I see that my hood is now sort of wrinkled and find out later that the hood will not close properly. I suggest to the young driver that we exchange insurance info. This while she is busy taking pics of her car (no damage) with her iphone. She hesitates about forking over the insurance info and I say that we can get the police there if she would like, so we do, pulling into a nearby parking lot to wait, and wait. The cop arrives...license, registration and insurance please. I'm w/o my insurance card but live nearby so the cop lets me go home to get it. When I get back 10 minutes later mom has arrived in her Hummer and is busy chatting up the cop. I go over to give my insurance card to the cop, reach out my hand to introduce myself to mom, and mom says, \"Not interested.\" I say Heppy New Year to you too and turn to the cop and ask him he can believe the rudeness of these people. Mom then makes snide remarks about other dents in my van. I'm showing some restraint to what I'm now really sensing are a couple of real lowlifes. The cop writes up his report, does not cite the offending driver and says we should let our insurance companies figure it out. Fine. We retreat to our vehicles with police report and insurance info in hand. Laredo driver pulls out of parking lot, followed by Hummer Mom, who, as she pulls out, flips me a big ugly middle finger. \r\n",

I look down at the police report and see the name, address and phone number of the driver. I write a text to the driver and hit send. What did the text say? Your mother is a scumbag. That's it.\r\n",

They argue constantly, and he's hit her twice [*edit*] that I know of (she doesn't tell me much anymore, because she knows how I react). She attempted to justify it to me by saying stuff like, \"Well, the first time, I'd called his mom a bitch, and the second time, I'd slapped him for yelling at me.\"  She has convinced herself that it's okay, and that she was asking for it.  She claims that he is going to therapy, and has been for a year or so (in my view, because the abuse came after he'd already been in therapy for months, this is moot).  He is insanely jealous, and reads all her texts, emails, and stalks her Facebook (she's had to change her password several times).  Right now, they're \"off,\" and she is trying to date other guys, but he makes it difficult for her because he gets so jealous, and fucks with her head.  He tells her how much he loves her, and how sorry he is for how he behaved/behaves, and how it was a mistake to let her go (he did the breaking up, the most recent time).  She says she loves him, even after what he did to her, and gets mad at me when I try to tell her that if I was in her position, she'd want to castrate my abuser.  \"You don't understand.  You don't know him like I do, and stuff like this is why he hates you so much!  I love him!\"  Reddit, I don't know what to tell this girl, and I'm going crazy seeing my friend get hurt like this.  Have any of you been in an abusive relationship?  Were you the victim or the abuser?  What motivated you to stay, or to leave?  I would especially like to hear the view of an abuser.  I can't wrap my head around what motivates that kind of behavior, and I really want some perspective.\n",

I've found some information, but not nearly enough, so I figured that picking the reddit community's brain might be the best way to get the information I need.  So, with no further ado...\n",

Now, however, I'm beginning to realize that's not really it.

It seems like that sort of work is the most prevalent for telecommuting.\n",

We went inside, got checked and everything and met my friend in the visitation room and everything went fine for about 20 minutes or so. We had 30 minutes of visitation. After about 20 minutes there was a small child with one of the other families and it started screaming really loudly and suddendly. It was a pretty horrible scream. The kind of baby scream that makes you want the parents to take the child away.\r\n",

He ran to the corner of the room and curled up into a ball, crying absolutely hysterically. I ran over to him, my friend was footcuffed to the table and I tried to figure out what was going on... I asked him what was wrong. He just yelled at me, \"GET MY FUCKING GUN. GET ME A FUCKING GUN.\" I had never seen what somewhat actually clinically insane looked like, but he had a look on his face that was just that. We had to call an ambulance. The medics came and they had to sedate him. The guy is 250 lbs, benches around 400lbs and is 6'4\".\r\n",

He then told me that he had been a door gunner, and that the captives that they had in the helicopters sometimes would not talk, and that they, the soldiers, would throw the captives family from the helicopter into the chopper blades of another helicopter below them to try and get them to talk. He said on one occassion his partner threw a child... and he said that is what triggered this.\r\n",

      "    a. Uninstall the web browser you used to download the torrent file (If you used IE then you deserve to get caught). Go into \"Program Files\",\"Application Data\",and \"Local Settings\" and find the folders pertaining to that program and delete the subfolders for that program.\n",
      "\n",
      "    b. Repeat (a) for your torrent program, any program you've open the files with (ex. vlc), or any program that crawls your folders for media (ex. itunes). If you used windows media player, then you can clear your history but not uninstall. This may or may not work, but again, if you're using WMP, then you deserve to get caught.\n",

      "    d. (optional) Run a registry cleaner. Just in case somehow file data from one of the programs you've deleted ended up in the registry. Doubt there's anything like that in there, but it doesn't hurt. If you do this, make sure you remove the register cleaner via instructions (a).\n",

      "    f. MOST IMPORTANT STEP. If you skip this step then you've wasted your time up until now. Open up a command prompt and enter \"cipher /w:c\". This will wipe all of the free space on your c drive. If you had the file on another drive (say d). Then you would type \"cipher /w:d\" as well. By deleting the settings files (rather than clearing history), you ensure that the hard drive blocks have been released back into the free-space pool, and will get picked up by the cipher.\n",
      "\n",

      "457. Strange Situation So Last October I applied for a Senior tech support job. It was a great job with a lot of challenging tasks. This guy from the company calls me, calls himself a 'recruiter' for that company and gives me an easy phone interview, asking how confident I am in my skills, can I travel, etc.\n",
      "I get the in person interview and I flaked and didn't know some of the answers. The recruiter said he'd call me to let me know the verdict 'good, bad or indifferent'. He never called. I finally called him three times to get the verdict that 'they have decided to pass on me'.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month later I see a posting for the same company, mid level tech support and I apply. The same recruiter calls me all excited and says he's very interested in talking to me. The way he's talking he doesn't remember me at all. Fine, no big deal. He says he'll try to get me in for an interview ASAP and will call me the next day. \n",
      "He doesn't call. I email him the next week and he replies that he's still trying to get me in for an interview.\n",
      "Get this: He CALLS ME THE NEXT DAY. Says he's very interested in getting me in for an interview! So yes, this is his third call to me in which he gives his whole shpeal about the job and company, as if he's never talked to me before! weird. I had to go out of town on business with my current company so he says call me when you get back. I do, he doesn't answer his phone the week of christmas or the week after. He finally emails me back this week and lo and behold, I'm scheduled for another interview for this mid level tech support position.\n",
      "\n",
      "SECOND KICKER: I'm interviewing with the same guy who interviewed me, and apparently passed on me the first time. \n",
      "SO, what do I do? Pretend I've never talked to these guys before and just go balls out positive and try to interview really well and get the job? What if the interviewer says uh hey, I know you. I don't like you. I didn't like you then and I don't like you now. Leave this place...\n",
      "\n",
      "TL DR: Same guy called me about a job twice after passing on me for another job, and each time they act like they've never talked to me before.

One of her favourite movies is Blue Velvet, and we recently watched Valley of the Dolls and Chocolat.  Also, she is a big fan of Atom Egoyan - recently saw Exotica.  Any ideas?  this is a throw away account as my main could easily trace back to me in real life.

It's a communal mens bathroom for the floor, with 4 stalls, the one at the end is, as you know, much, much better.  For the handicapped? Sure. For everyone else to use as a luxury stall? I'd like to think so. It's got more space, a heightened seating position so your knees don't come up to your chin or so you don't have to slouch, and a nifty little grab bar to ease your lifting and sitting of the ass to seat.

It only lasted one season, so it either was exceptionally good (Like Firefly) or exceptionally bad (Like Stargate Universe). Considering that I can not find it online tells me that it is probably the latter of the two. Nevertheless, I would at least like to know the name of it. The best description that I can come up with is that it was a murder mystery show and that the lead character was a modern day Sherlock Holmes. He lived in a house with a lot of \"Smart Home\" features such as voice commands for lights and HVAC. If I remember correctly the home had an A.I. that communicated with a womens voice. I was only twelve when it came out and I was fascinated by the logic puzzles that the main character would solve effortlessly. I loved the show back then and it bugs me that I can not seem to find any reference to it online.\n",

      "Then yesterday I was exiting the freeway near my office and as I came around the exit ramp and began to merge onto the main road to take the overpass over the freeway towards my office there were some cars coming so I stopped to wait for them to pass before merging in.  To my mind it is common knowledge that in that kind of situation the driver in my position always yields to oncoming traffic on the main road I'm merging onto.  There is also a sign there instructing drivers to yield as well.  As soon as I came to a stop, the person in the car behind me started laying on there horn like I was backing up into them or something only I wasn't backing up.  They were angry that I had stopped even though I was simply obeying traffic laws and being a responsible driver.  Normally I would just brush that off or at the most just be like, \"What's your problem?\"  In this instance however, I very quickly became absolutely livid!  I almost jumped out of my car to go back and give this person a piece of my mind.

      "\n",
      "My mother arrived from Cuba in 1985, legally by plane and was issued her residency. A few years later, my mother was involved with a charge of \"drug posession with intent to distribute.\" Her car was transporting marijuana in Louisiana. They gave her 4 years of probation, and it was removed quickly due to good behavior. My mother is a kind person. She had never previously or since had any run-ins with the law. When I was born in 1989 she immediately focused her efforts on raising my brother and myself (and I must say she gave me a beautiful childhood, I never had any idea of problems such as she might have faced along the way. We grew up just like any american children would have).\n",

      "It has been 20 years since that charge. Louisiana issued her a pardon for the crime. She applied for citizenship in 1997 and was denied. Once again in 2008 she took the citizenship exam, passed with flying colors, yet was denied citizenship again. Apparently through the process of looking at her application, she was suddenly issued a statement that noted she was eligible for deportation. She is set to appear in court on March 10th.\n",

      "She's terrified. I keep getting arguments on both sides, saying she's going to \"win\" at court no problem, and that they can't deport Cubans, and that her crime was so small and long ago that they couldn't possibly punish her for it now. She still doesn't know what to do. Her English isn't perfect and she's very easy to scare. She's been crying every day for the last few weeks. The few lawyers that we would have been able to afford are apparently 'too busy' to take the case.\n",

      "194. Why does reddit's search feature suck a fuck? If you search anything it pretty much gives you no results every single time. This sucks a fuck.\n",
